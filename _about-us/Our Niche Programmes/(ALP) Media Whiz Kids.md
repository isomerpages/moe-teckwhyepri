<p>Teck Whye Primary School believes that communication is the key to success
in the 21st century. Our signature Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in
Languages - <strong>Media Whiz Kids - </strong>is designed to nurture students
into confident and competent communicators capable of producing engaging
and creative content across various presentation media.</p>
<p><strong>A Holistic Approach to Media Literacy</strong>
</p>
<p>Our carefully curated programme is a collaboration between the English
Language (EL) and Mother Tongue Language (MTL) departments. It is integrated
with the STELLAR and MTL units. Using a tiered approach, we ensure that
students progressively build their media literacy and critical thinking
skills from Lower Primary to Upper Primary.</p>
