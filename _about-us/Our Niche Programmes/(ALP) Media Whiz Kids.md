<p>Teck Whye Primary School believes that communication is the key to success
in the 21st century. Our signature Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in
Languages - <strong>Media Whiz Kids - </strong>is designed to nurture students
into confident and competent communicators capable of producing engaging
and creative content across various presentation media.</p>
<p><strong>A Holistic Approach to Media Literacy</strong>
<br>Our carefully curated programme is a collaboration between the English
Language (EL) and Mother Tongue Language (MTL) departments. It is integrated
with the STELLAR and MTL units. Using a tiered approach, we ensure that
students progressively build their media literacy and critical thinking
skills from Lower Primary to Upper Primary.</p>

<p><strong>Lower Primary: Language through the Arts &amp; Digital Storytelling</strong>
<br>Building a Strong Foundation Through Engaging Experiences:</p>

<p><em><sup>A Mother Tongue language drama experience for P2 students.</sup></em>
<br><strong>Language Arts and Performance:</strong> Students embark on their
media literacy journey through immersive language arts lessons in the school-based
English curriculum. The skills and values learned through drama added value
to the Mother Tongue Language speech and drama lessons during curriculum
hours.&nbsp;In this hands-on environment, they gain confidence through
stage experience, dramatic performances, and storytelling, enhanced with
audio, visuals, and lighting effects. The experience also inculcates the
school values of collaboration, responsibility, respect and resilience.
These experiences give them the tools to become expressive storytellers
who understand the power of media in creative expression.</p>

<br><strong>Digital Storytelling:</strong> Taking their storytelling skills
further, students explore various forms of drama and stage setups. They
will:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Watch live drama performances, bringing stories to life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Observe behind-the-scenes production processes, such as filming a live
cooking show.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Script and perform in front of their peers at the school's green screen
studio.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These experiences empower students to express themselves creatively and
develop confidence in media production.</p>

<br>Taking Media Literacy to the Next Level:</p>
<p><strong>Exploration &amp; Inquiry:</strong> As students advance, they develop
digital literacy by learning to discern and evaluate information from print
and digital resources. Leveraging classroom iPads and Chromebooks, students
engage in inquiry-based learning by exploring unit themes and working collaboratively
using digital tools such as the Student Learning Space (SLS). Teachers
guide students through graphic organisers and prompts to scaffold their
thought processes, fostering meaningful interactions and collaborative
knowledge-building.</p>
<p><strong>Creative Content Producer:</strong> At this stage, students are
encouraged to take ownership of their learning by selecting the media format
that best represents their ideas. They can choose to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Create advertisements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use digital platforms to share knowledge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Produce videos to narrate their school experiences.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This creative autonomy allows students to apply their media literacy skills
in real-world contexts and become proficient content creators.</p>
