With heads held high  
Our flag we fly  
We stand with confidence and pride  
We face the world with this one aim  
Honour and Victory to gain

Aspire and Achieve  
Excelling at work and play  
With a heart to make a difference  
Touching lives along the way

Aspire and Achieve  
Let us always give our best  
To bring Glory and Fame  
To win a name for Teck Whye Primary  
For Teck Whye Primary
