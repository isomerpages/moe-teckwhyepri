<p><strong>Welcome to the new year!</strong>
</p>
<p>I am truly honored to take on the role of Principal at Teck Whye Primary
School (TWPS) and to build upon the strong foundation laid by previous
principals. Under the guidance of each dedicated leader, TWPS has flourished
into a caring and innovative learning environment where students are encouraged
to (i) learn to care, (ii) care to learn, and (iii) be future-ready. I
am deeply grateful for the past leadership, whose contributions have been
integral to the school’s success and have created such a supportive and
vibrant environment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As we begin 2025, I am excited to work alongside all of you—staff, parents,
stakeholders, and the broader community—on the journey ahead. Our staff
have always been the heart of TWPS, bringing dedication, creativity, and
care to every aspect of school life. Together, we will continue to uphold
our school’s mission of inspiring and empowering learners through care
and innovation. I am committed to creating a space where every child feels
valued and can thrive, while also ensuring that staff are supported, appreciated,
and empowered to grow professionally.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This year presents great opportunities for all of us at TWPS. Together,
as One Teck Whye, let’s make 2025 a year to reflect our collective commitment
to unfolding new possibilities for our students, staff, and community.
It will also be a time to honor the school’s past, affirm the present,
and foster an environment where students and staff feel cared for, continue
to learn, and grow as individuals ready to face the future with confidence.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I look forward to partnering with each of you as we nurture and shape
the next chapter of TWPS. Together, let's cultivate a joyful and future-ready
learning environment where every child flourishes, every staff member grows,
and our collective efforts sow the seeds of endless possibilities for the
future.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With gratitude for our partnership.
