<p>Parents are crucial stakeholders to the school. We are thankful for a
group of parents who have volunteered their services to the school to enrich
the lives of the pupils.</p>
<p>The PSG help our Primary 1 pupils settle into the school, especially during
the recess. They are in the canteen to help pupils during recesses.</p>
<p>The PSG are also actively involved in the schoolâ€™s events. They significantly
contribute to the organisation and management of school events. Not only
that, they also design stage decorations to create the right atmosphere
for events. They help with event booths, promoting the culture of various
ethnic groups, National Education messages, green messages and many more.
Furthermore, they put up unique and vibrant performances on special occasions.</p>
<p>Parent Volunteers accompany pupils on learning journeys and competitions.
They are always ready and willing to lend a hand.</p>
<p>We deeply appreciate the time and effort put in by the PSG and we welcome
more parents to come on board.</p>
