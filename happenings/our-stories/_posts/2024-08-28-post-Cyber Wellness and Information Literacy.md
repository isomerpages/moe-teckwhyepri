<p>Teck Whye Primary School was featured on 8world (a one-stop Chinese digital
portal by Mediacorp) News on 2 August, for its innovative approach to teaching
cyber wellness and information literacy.</p>
<p>In today’s digitally connected world, while ICT offers vast learning opportunities,
there is a need to protect our students against inappropriate online content
and influence. To develop our students to be discerning consumers of online
content, cyber wellness has become a vital component of our Character and
Citizenship Education (CCE). Since 2021, the CHAMPs Journal—a supplementary
instructional resource developed by the school—has been crucial in equipping
students with essential cyber wellness knowledge. Through thoughtfully
designed activities, checklists and reflective writing, the journal helps
students internalize cyber safety lessons and promotes responsible online
behaviour.</p>
<p>Additionally, the school equips P3 students with information literacy
skills, teaching them how to assess the validity and reliability of online
information.</p>
