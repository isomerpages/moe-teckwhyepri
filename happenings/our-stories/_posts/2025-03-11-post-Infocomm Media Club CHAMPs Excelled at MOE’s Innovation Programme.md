<p>The Infocomm Media Club CHAMPs excelled at MOE’s Innovation Programme
(IvP), earning a Certificate of Distinction for their outstanding project,
“Teck Whye Pri Sch (TWPS) Travel-verse”! Designed to help Primary 1 students
overcome travel anxiety, “TWPS Travel-verse” leverages coding to create
an interactive virtual learning space. Through engaging visuals and immersive

young learners with essential independent travel skills, fostering confidence
and self-reliance.</p>
