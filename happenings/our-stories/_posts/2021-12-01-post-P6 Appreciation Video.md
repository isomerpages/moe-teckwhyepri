Our P6 graduates of Class 2021 made an appreciation video to thank all who have made a difference in their lives in&nbsp;Teck Whye Primary School&nbsp;over the last six years. We also managed to continue the tradition of our P6 students expressing their gratitude to their parents this year despite the Covid-19 restrictions. Click on the link&nbsp;here&nbsp;to watch the heartfelt video that was shown during the P6 Graduation Tea and Level Awards Ceremony to find out how we did it. Congratulations once again to our P6 CHAMPs. May you aspire and achieve wherever you go!
