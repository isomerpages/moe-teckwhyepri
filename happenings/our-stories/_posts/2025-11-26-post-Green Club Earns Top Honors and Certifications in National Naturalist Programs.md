<p>Our Green Club proudly participated in the Every Singaporean A Naturalist
Programme by the Nature Society and clinched First Place for the “Most
Improved School (2024–2025)” award, recognising our growth in research-grade
observations. The club also took part in the NSS ESN Skills Achievement
Programme, where students completed written and practical tasks. We are
delighted to share that our Green Club members have earned their Novice
Naturalist for Birds certificate and badge.</p>
