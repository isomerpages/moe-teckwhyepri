Four of our P5 and P6 Tamil students took part in the National Tamil Debate (Sorpor 2023) organized by the Tamil Representative Council. Our school debated against Marymount Convent School in the finals and emerged champions for 2023. 

This amazing journey began on 18 February and culminated on 29 April. Our second speaker, Venkatesan Venbha of 6-5 emerged best speaker during the quarter-final. Meanwhile, our first speaker, Kanthakumar Jayashri of 6-5, was nominated the best speaker during the semi-final. In the finals, our third speaker, Arivazhagan Kiriyeathra of 5-4, emerged the best speaker. Abhinayya Saravanan of 5-5 who was our reserve speaker, supported her teammates throughout the whole debate. This whole experience built up the teams’ confidence and resilience. Great work, CHAMPs! 

Our deepest appreciation to the Tamil Language Teachers, that is, Mdm Magespari, Mdm M Vennila and Mdm Arockiamary, for guiding and supporting the debate team throughout the competition. Their dedication and commitment enriched our students’ learning experiences beyond the classrooms.
