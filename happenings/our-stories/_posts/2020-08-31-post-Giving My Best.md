I am Mohamed Imran Bin Moosa. I am currently a Police Officer and an alumnus of Teck Whye Primary School. I was enrolled in Teck Whye Primary School in 1990.

To me, Teck Whye Primary School is not just a school for academic learning, but also a place that builds strong character. It is the place where the education I received has made me who I am today.

As a student back then, my build was quite small. However, it did not deter me from playing my most beloved sport — soccer. Although there were challenges for me to overcome, I learnt to capitalise my strengths when I was coached by Mdm Azlina Hassan, my role model.

Mdm Azlina always made sure every soccer player finished our schoolwork before we were allowed to train and play soccer. She also ensured that her football players were highly disciplined both on and off the pitch, and maintained our level of fitness. Despite my small frame, I was able to run fast and I was good at defence. Madam Azlina encouraged me to work on my strengths and I was eventually able to defend bigger-sized opponents very well. She used to say, “If the opponent comes towards your area, stand your ground and keep your eye on the ball. Your size doesn't matter because you are faster.” Whenever I got nervous during games back then, her words would help calm me and give me confidence.

Her words not only helped me a lot as a student, but also as an adult when I am faced with challenges.&nbsp; As a Police Officer, I am required to maintain a high level of discipline and fitness to safeguard Singapore.&nbsp; While patrolling the streets, I am required at times to handle hostile situations in a composed manner. What I had learnt in Teck Whye Primary School has also helped me manage such challenging situations calmly and effectively.

Another important lesson I have learnt in school is to be sincere always and give my best in everything I do. The late Mr John Goh, who was the Discipline Master then, used to say, “If you want to do something, you must be sincere.&nbsp; Don’t bother trying if you are not.” His words had a big impact on me. Since then, I always believed that good deeds make a person richer. I always encourage friends, family and loved ones to pay it forward because when you help a person, it will make you happy too.

My positive attitude and the values I had learnt at Teck Whye Primay have helped me to achieve multiple awards and commendations over the years. Life is full of challenges but I believe that if we adopt a positive mindset, we can overcome any challenge! It is also important to have dreams and aspirations because they drive us to constantly improve ourselves. Do not let challenges hamper your dreams but strive hard to overcome them because when you give your best and finally achieve your goals, you would have grown from the experience and become a better person.
