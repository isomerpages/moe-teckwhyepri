Rebecca advocates for the environment in her role as a Green Officer, while Ramprabhu encourages his schoolmates to adopt healthy habits as a Health Ambassador. Zander and Ralinka, assistant class councillors of their classes, also exhibit exemplary behaviour in leading and supporting their classmates. They are just a few of our many students who consistently exhibit our school values. They readily step forward to lend a helping hand to others without hesitation, thus earning respect from their peers.
