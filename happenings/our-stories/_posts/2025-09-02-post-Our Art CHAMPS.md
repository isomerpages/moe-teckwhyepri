<p>Our talented P6 CHAMPs were awarded a Certificate of Recognition at the
Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Art Exhibition 2025 for their captivating
macro photography piece, “Savouring Singapore: Tiny Textures, Timeless
Tastes.” In celebration of SG60, the artwork showcases the intricate textures
and enduring charm of local cuisine. Through perseverance, curiosity, and
collaboration, our CHAMPs brought their creative vision to life, producing
a meaningful and memorable tribute to Singapore’s rich food heritage.</p>
