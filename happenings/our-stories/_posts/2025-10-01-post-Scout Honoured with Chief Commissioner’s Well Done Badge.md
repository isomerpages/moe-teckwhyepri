<p>Congratulations to Matthew Chua (P6-4) on receiving the Chief Commissioner’s
Well-Done Badge from the Singapore Scouts Association. Matthew exemplifies
the Scout Promise through responsibility, patience and care, always supporting
younger Cub Scouts and stepping in without being asked. His quiet leadership
and genuine concern inspire peers, showing true Scout spirit. We are proud
of you, Matthew.</p>
