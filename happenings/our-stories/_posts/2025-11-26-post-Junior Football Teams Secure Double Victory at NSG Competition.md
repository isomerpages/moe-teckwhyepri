<p>We are filled with pride as we celebrate our Junior Football Teams for
clinching 1st place in their NSG competitions. The Junior Boys emerged
as champions in the Tier 7 group, while the Junior Girls triumphed in the
Tier 2 group. Their parallel journeys to the top reflect their hard work,
resilience and strong team spirit. From every practice to every match,
their growth and determination have been truly inspiring. Heartiest congratulations
to all our junior athletes and coaches on this outstanding and well-deserved
achievement.</p>
