<p>Our Green Club was invited by the Nature Society (Singapore) to lead a
workshop at the Festival of Biodiversity 2025! Held at the National Library
on 1 June, the session titled "Exploring Singaporeâ€™s Wildlife: A Hands-On
Learning Experience" saw our CHAMPs engaging the public through interactive
stations on local birds, mammals and endangered species. It was a meaningful
platform for our CHAMPs to promote environmental education and grow as
confident, passionate advocates for nature.</p>
