I am Kaixin and I am currently studying in Nanyang Girls’ High School. My experience in Teck Whye Primary School has been nothing short of a fruitful and amazing one. TWPS has shaped who I am today and gifted me with all sorts of valuable lessons and experiences. With academics not as its top priority, TWPS strives to provide a holistic development to each and every student who passes through its gates.

Firstly, the learning journeys were highlights of my life in TWPS. I had the opportunity to go on various learning journeys, both locally and even internationally. From going on trips to Singapore Zoo or Science Centre, to overnight camps in Primary 4 and overseas trips in Primary 5, learning was not simply confined to the four walls of classrooms. For example, after having a literature lesson on E. B. White’s “Charlotte’s Web” we would watch a theatrical play of the same story, consolidating the lesson. Apart from the sparks these learning journeys added to my six years in TWPS, they have also taught me many lifelong soft skills. On my overseas trip to Nanjing, China, I truly realised what being independent meant and it has helped me grow a lot as a person. TWPS does a blend of both traditional classroom learning as well as hands-on learning outside of classrooms, effectively teaching myself and many other students, both hard and soft skills.

Next, a school without teachers and support staff would simply be a plain old building, devoid of meaning and purpose. Throughout my primary school years, the people around me were the ones who truly made a difference and impacted my life. Words cannot express how caring and attentive my teachers were to us, not just making sure our grades were alright, but really paying attention to us as individuals, taking note of our emotions and state of mind. They did not just walk into school with the sole purpose of teaching the syllabus and then leaving. They came in to teach us from right to wrong, to equip us with the necessary skills to enter society, to let us know that they are there for us, to guide us. The core values of respect, responsibility, integrity, compassion, resilience and excellence will follow me for the rest of my life, a reminder that the most important thing in a person would always be their character. In addition, the support staff played such an important role in my experience in TWPS. I still recall vividly how the security guard at the gate would wave fondly at students coming to school, even addressing quite a number of students by their names. Every single support staff member impacted the school in their own way, all of them uniquely important. Only with their presence, did TWPS really feel like a second home to me.

Every school has their own unique beam of light but TWPS will forever hold this special place in my heart. To everyone whom I have met along the way and crossed paths with, thank you, I am really grateful for everything that you have done. I would not trade these 6 years for anything in the world and I am proud to say that I graduated from Teck Whye Primary School.
