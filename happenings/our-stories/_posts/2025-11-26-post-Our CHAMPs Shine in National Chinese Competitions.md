<p>We are proud of our CHAMPs who represented our school in three national
Chinese language competitions, earning medals and certificates through
their hard work and perseverance. A heartfelt thank you to our dedicated
teachers for their guidance, and to our supportive parents for encouraging
the children throughout their journey. These experiences strengthened our
students’ confidence and appreciation of the Chinese language and culture.
Well done to all our CHAMPs!</p>
