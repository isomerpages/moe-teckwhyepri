<p>Our Malay Language students shone brightly this year through a range of
competitions that celebrated their creativity, teamwork and passion for
the language. In the Piala Tun Sri Lanang poetry recitation competition,
they impressed with expressive video entries, earning both a second place
award and a Most Creative Video accolade. In the Berita Harian Podcast
competition, our students shared thoughtful hopes for SG100, with one student
recognised as the Best Podcaster for primary schools.</p>
