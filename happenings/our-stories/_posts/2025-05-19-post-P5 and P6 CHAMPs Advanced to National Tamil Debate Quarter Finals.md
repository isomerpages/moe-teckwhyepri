<p>We are proud to celebrate the achievements of our P5 and P6 CHAMPs, who
advanced to the quarter-finals of the National Tamil Debate Competition.
This experience went beyond the contest itself, offering valuable opportunities
for students to develop critical thinking, articulate their ideas with
confidence and engage in respectful, thoughtful discussions. Through teamwork
and perseverance, they grew as confident communicators and reflective learners.
Well done to our CHAMPs for embracing the spirit of learning and growth!</p>
