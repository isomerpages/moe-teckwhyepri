### WE STories – Getting to Know West Zone Secondary Schools

Dear Parents/Guardians

We would like to share with you the WE STories publication, which is a collection of stories from all the West Zone secondary schools. We hope that this publication will be useful for you to guide your child to choose a secondary school that can cater to your child’s interests and strengths. Within the publication, you will find a map that shows the geographical location of the secondary schools. The clickable location pins on the map will lead you directly to the respective school’s story. We hope you can make use of this resource to make an informed school choice together with your child.
