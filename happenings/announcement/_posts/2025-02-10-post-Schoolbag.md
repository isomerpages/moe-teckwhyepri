<p>Launched in 2008, Schoolbag is MOE’s signature repository of school stories
that are useful and relevant to parents with school-going children. Over
the years, it has grown into a viable communications channel of the Ministry,
exceeding 600,000 views yearly. Last year, there was a revamp to refresh
the features of the website to deliver a more engaging experience, more
efficiently, to busy parents. &nbsp;</p>
