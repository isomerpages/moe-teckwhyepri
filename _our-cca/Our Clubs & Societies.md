<p>Our CCA are designed to cater to our pupilsâ€™ holistic well-being. We believe
that we need to help pupils develop the skills, values and attitudes to
manage their learning, emotional development, social interactions and physical
well-being. Equipping them with the appropriate skills and nurturing the
right attitudes and dispositions will help them to lead wholesome lives
well into their teenage years and adulthood.</p>
