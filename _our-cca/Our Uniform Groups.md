<p>Our CCA are designed to cater to our pupils’ holistic well-being. We believe
that we need to help pupils develop the skills, values and attitudes to
manage their learning, emotional development, social interactions and physical
well-being. Equipping them with the appropriate skills and nurturing the
right attitudes and dispositions will help them to lead wholesome lives
well into their teenage years and adulthood.</p>

<p>Members will go through a programme in an environment that is intellectually
and physically stimulating for personal development. They will go through
challenges for which they will learn to overcome through their critical
thinking and physical abilities. Members will also learn about the Scouts’
Law and take part in team building, problem solving skills, campcraft and
