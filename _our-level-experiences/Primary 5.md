<h3>Primary 5 Level Experience</h3>
<p><strong>Mother Tongue Fortnight</strong>
<br>To promote a greater appreciation of the various cultures in Singapore,
P5 students will take part in the Mother Tongue Fortnight. The students
will gain a deeper appreciation of their own Mother Tongue through the
various cultural activities carried out during the two days.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>National Education (NE) Show</strong>&nbsp;
<br>A familiar highlight for a P5 student is the&nbsp;<strong>National Education (NE) Show</strong>&nbsp;which
is essentially a preview of the National Day Parade. They will get to enjoy
aerobatic displays by F-16 fighter jets, landings by the Red Lions parachutists,
and a security operations demonstration by the Singapore Armed Forces and
Home Team called the Total Defence Display.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Social Studies Museum-Based Learning</strong>
<br>As part of the Social Studies syllabus, Primary 5 students will embark
on a journey to the <strong>Indian Heritage Centre </strong>to trace the
history of the Indian and South Asian communities in the Southeast Asian
region.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>P5 Camp</strong>
<br>With the theme<strong> “Beyond Self, Beyond Boundaries”</strong>, the
P5 Camp which will be<strong> </strong>held in September is something all
P5 students look forward to. The camp provides opportunities for students
to explore new places, learn something new and spend more time in nature.&nbsp;They
will also learn to be resilient and responsible as they look after themselves
and their team-mates. &nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Sports Education Programme</strong>
<br>To provide each Teck Whyean the opportunity to pick up the new sport as
a team, the P5 students are introduced to <strong>tchoukball</strong>. Though
it is a highly intensive game comprising of strategic passing, coordinated
runs and powerful shots, it is a unique non-contact sport that encapsulates
the spirit of camaraderie, discipline and technique.</p>
