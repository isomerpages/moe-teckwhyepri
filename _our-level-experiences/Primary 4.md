### Primary 4 Level Experience
**P4 Camp @ Teck Whye Primary School**

This year, all Primary 4 pupils participated in the P4 Adventure Camp @ Teck Whye Primary School. The TWPS PE Department recreated a wonderful experience with the support of other teachers to conduct a non-residential TWPS camp on 11th and 12th March.  During the camp, the pupils took part in team-bonding activities, problem-solving activities, attended a leadership training, went on a hike to Pang Sua Park and even participated in a virtual camping at night. They applied concepts learnt in the classroom curriculum to solve problems in the authentic situations and also the opportunity to work cohesively in their assigned groups to display the school values in action. 

**P4 SwimSafer Programme**

As part of the MOE PE Syllabus, the SwimSafer programme is compulsory for all Primary 4 pupils. This is a national water safety programme which is designed to equip a child with the necessary skills to learn swimming at the end of the course. The programme aims to help the students gain confidence and develop independence in the water, as well as learn general and deep-end water safety. Lessons will be conducted by qualified coaches registered with the National Registry of Coaches. 

Through the swimming programme, pupils will learn to be water-safe and acquire lifelong swimming skills. Pupils will be grouped according to their swimming abilities. At the end of the programme, pupils will be assessed on their ability to demonstrate water safety and swimming proficiency. A certificate of achievement will be awarded to pupils, indicating their proficiency levels. Each class will also have exclusive use of the entire swimming pool as it is closed to the public during the lessons.  Although the pupils only attended a few sessions due to the heightened alert, they enjoyed themselves tremendously and looked forward to these swimming lessons in the future

**P4 Virtual Museum Tour**

This year, the P4 pupils will also had the chance to attend a virtual tour at the National Gallery.  The virtual tour was facilitated by Education Facilitators who showcased selected artworks from the National Collection via a live tour. This is a part of the Aesthetics and Social Studies syllabus which gave pupils an insight on the development of Singapore through the years. The artefacts in the museums provide pupils with a glimpse of some of the key developments in the years after Singapore’s independence.

**Music Appreciation @ Teck Whye Primary School**

Our P4 passionate learners completed the Foundation Ukulele module with pride and resilience. Covid -19 or not, we keep the joy of learning in TWPS!

**E2k Mathematics and Science Programme for P4 students**

The E2K Science programme aims to develop scientific inquiry process skills where pupils learn Science by going through the same process that scientists use to generate knowledge. 

The E2K Mathematics programme aims to develop pupils’ mathematical reasoning skills and deepen their conceptual understanding through an inquiry approach. Pupils will have opportunities to collaborate with their peers and engage in mathematical thinking through resources such as puzzles, games and mathematics explorations which are specially designed for the programme. The rich learning experiences offered by the programmes serve to help pupils to develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions scientists and mathematicians possess, as well as to gain important 21st century competencies such as critical and inventive thinking and effective communication skills.
