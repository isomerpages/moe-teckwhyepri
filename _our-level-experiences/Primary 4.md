<h3>Primary 4 Level Experience</h3>
<p><strong>P4 SwimSafer Programme</strong>
<br>As part of the MOE PE Syllabus, the SwimSafer programme is compulsory
for all Primary 4 students. This is a national water safety programme which
is designed to equip a child with the necessary skills to learn swimming
at the end of the course. The programme aims to help the students gain
confidence and develop independence in the water, as well as learn general
and deep-end water safety. Lessons will be conducted by qualified coaches
registered with the National Registry of Coaches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the swimming programme, students will learn to be water-safe and
acquire lifelong swimming skills. Students will be grouped according to
their swimming abilities. At the end of the programme, students will be
assessed on their ability to demonstrate water safety and swimming proficiency.
A certificate of achievement will be awarded to pupils, indicating their
proficiency levels. Each class will also have exclusive use of the entire
swimming pool as it is closed to the public during the lessons.&nbsp; Although
the students only attended a few sessions due to the heightened alert,
they enjoyed themselves tremendously and looked forward to these swimming
lessons in the future</p>
<p><strong>P4 Museum-based Learning&nbsp;</strong>
<br>The P4 students will get to visit the National Gallery for a guided tour
by Education Facilitators who showcased selected artworks from the National
Collection. This is a part of the Aesthetics and Social Studies syllabus
which gave students an insight on the development of Singapore through
the years. The artefacts in the museums provide students with a glimpse
of the art work and its artist.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Music Appreciation @ Teck Whye Primary School</strong>
<br>As part of the Primary 4 Music syllabus, students will embark on a Foundation
Ukulele program where they will learn basic chords such as C, G, F, and
Am, as well as simple strumming patterns. This engaging and hands-on experience
introduces students to foundational music skills, enhances their coordination,
and builds confidence as they play and perform familiar songs. The program
aims to foster a love for music while encouraging creativity and teamwork
through group jam sessions and class performances. The program will culminate
in a mini recital, where students can showcase their progress and celebrate
their musical journey with their peers and teachers.</p>
<p><strong>E2k Mathematics and Science Programme for P4 students</strong>
<br>The E2K Science programme aims to develop scientific inquiry process skills
where students learn Science by going through the same process that scientists
use to generate knowledge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The E2K Mathematics programme aims to develop studentsâ€™ mathematical reasoning
skills and deepen their conceptual understanding through an inquiry approach.
Pupils will have opportunities to collaborate with their peers and engage
in mathematical thinking through resources such as puzzles, games and mathematics
explorations which are specially designed for the programme. The rich learning
experiences offered by the programmes serve to help pupils to develop the
habits, attitudes and dispositions scientists and mathematicians possess,
as well as to gain important 21st century competencies such as critical
and inventive thinking and effective communication skills.</p>
<p><strong>P4 Kreta Ayer Heritage Gallery&nbsp;</strong>
<br>During their learning journey to Kreta Ayer Heritage Gallery, P4 students
will explore the rich heritage and history of Kreta Ayer, a cultural heartland
of Chinatown. Through archival materials and historical artifacts sourced
from the community, they will learn about traditional cultural forms such
as Nanyin music, Chinese puppetry, and calligraphy, as well as the area's
vibrant past in the 19th and 20th centuries. This experience helps students
appreciate the significance of cultural heritage in Singapore.
