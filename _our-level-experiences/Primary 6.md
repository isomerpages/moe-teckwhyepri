### Primary 6 Level Experience

**P6 Graduation Tea** 

The pupils’ TWPS journey is brought to a closure with the P6 Graduation Tea. During this celebration, pupils put up performances which showcase their talents and at the same time, allow the pupils to reminisce about their time in Teck Whye Primary School before they move on to their next stage in life.

**Sports Education Programme**

To encourage pupils to stay active and healthy, pupils are taught various sports. At Primary 6, pupils learn the proper techniques of bowling taught by certified coaches as part of the Sports Education Programme.

**Hands-on etiquette Workshop**

The Primary 6 pupils are trained to be future ready and be equipped with the skills beneficial for the future. Pupils will also learn about social and dining etiquette through a hands-on workshop.

**Social Studies Field-based Learning**

To encourage pupils to be more environmentally aware, the Primary 6 pupils will be going to Gardens by the Bay for their Social Studies Field-based Learning. They will learn about deforestation and how it contributes to global warming through the ‘Where Did My Home Go’ educational tour.

**Theatre productions & Mother Tongue Fortnight**

To promote a greater appreciation of the Arts, P6 pupils attend Percussion enrichment lessons, watch theatre productions and have an in-depth study of a chosen literature text. The pupils will also gain a deeper appreciation of Mother Tongue through the various activities carried out during Mother Tongue Fortnight.
