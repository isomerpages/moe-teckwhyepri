<h3>Primary 6 Level Experience</h3>
<p><strong>Mother Tongue Fortnight</strong>
<br>To promote a greater appreciation of the various cultures in Singapore,
P6 students will take part in the Mother Tongue Fortnight. The students
will gain a deeper appreciation of their own Mother Tongue through the
various cultural activities carried out during the two days.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Social Studies Museum-Based Learning</strong>
<br>To encourage students to understand Asia through Singapore, the Primary
6 students will be going to the <strong>Asian Civilisations Museum</strong>.<strong> </strong>Students
will learn more about&nbsp; the 9th century with the Tang Shipwreck collection,
and continue through displays of Asian export art – revealing the history
of Asian port cities and globalisation, long before the term was coined.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Sports Education Programme</strong>
<br>To encourage students to stay active and healthy, students at Teck Whye
are taught various sports. As part of the Children’s Day celebration, all
Primary 6 students will learn the proper techniques of <strong>bowling</strong> taught
by certified coaches as part of the&nbsp;Sports Education Programme. Through
bowling, students will develop crucial hand-eye coordination and depth
perception.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>P6 Internationalisation Trip</strong>
<br>Becoming an adaptive individual is learnt by the Primary 6 students when
they embark on their&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>P6 Internationalisation Trip</strong>&nbsp;to
Malacca, Malaysia. Every student is given the opportunity to go for the
trip, which aims to build resilience and independence in the child wherever
they are.&nbsp;Such trips help them develop new skills, make valuable connections,
and gain a better understanding of their counterparts in another country.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>P6 Graduation Day</strong>&nbsp;
<br>The students’ TWPS journey is brought to a closure with the&nbsp;<strong>P6 Graduation Day</strong>.
During this celebration, students put up performances which showcase their
talents and at the same time, allow the students to reminisce about their
time in Teck Whye Primary School before they move on to their next stage
in life. The day will start with students learning how to build their own
terrarium - a self-sustaining ecosystem that relies on natural cycles like
photosynthesis and water recycling to thrive without external resources.
It will end with the Award Ceremony followed by class performances. The
day is more meaningful as parents are invited to join in the celebration
in the hall.</p>
