<h3>Primary 1 Level Experience</h3>
<p><strong>PAL</strong>
<br>All P1 pupils will undergo&nbsp;<strong>Programme for Active Learning (PAL)</strong>&nbsp;during
curriculum time. It gives our pupils the opportunities to discover new
interests, learn new skills and build their characters. It also helps them
to develop their self-confidence and forge new friendships with their peers.
PAL is also a platform where pupils learn to find ways to solve problems
and how to make good decisions to solve them.&nbsp; In PAL, pupils are
exposed to varied and fun-learning experiences in four domains: Outdoor
Education, Sports and Games, Performing Arts and Visual Arts.</p>
<p><strong>Sports Education Programme</strong>
<br>To help each Teck Whyean be a Healthy Individual, P1 pupils will attend
Taekwondo exposure lessons as part of their&nbsp;<strong>Sports Education Programme</strong>.
Through this programme, pupils learn more about taekwondo, as well as pick
up some self-defence skills.</p>
<p><strong>Media Whiz Kids</strong>
<br>Through Speech and Drama lessons and engaging activities during the Mother
Tongue Fortnight, pupils hone their English and Mother Tongue languages.
A key focus is cultivating student awareness as Media Whiz Kids. In this
immersive environment, pupils gain stage experience and immerse themselves
in dramatic performances, using audio, visuals, and lighting to enhance
their storytelling. This integration not only sets the mood but also delivers
a powerful narrative, empowering students to harness the full potential
of media in their creative expression.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Journeys</strong>
<br>P1 Neighbourhood Tour (NT):&nbsp; The Primary 1 pupils will&nbsp; embark
on an enriching in-house neighbourhood tour to learn about key places within
the community. Through this experience, they will learn about the purpose
of the various community spaces such as clinics, markets, and playgrounds,
and how they contribute to the daily lives of residents. The learning experience
also emphasizes the importance of respect and responsibility, encouraging
pupils to appreciate and care for the community.
