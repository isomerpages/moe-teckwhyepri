<h3>Primary 2 Level Experience</h3>
<p><strong>PAL</strong>
<br>All P2 pupils will undergo Programme for Active Learning (PAL) during
curriculum time. It gives our pupils the opportunities to discover new
interests, learn new skills and build their characters. It also helps them
to develop their self-confidence and forge new friendships with their peers.
In PAL, pupils are exposed to varied and fun-learning experiences in four
domains: Outdoor Education, Sports and Games, Performing Arts and Visual
Arts.</p>
<p><strong>Media Whiz Kids</strong>
<br>Building on their understanding of stage experience and dramatic performances,
pupils will explore various stage setups and forms of drama. Digital Storytelling
takes centre stage at this level, providing students with an online platform
to share their unique experiences and narratives. They can watch a live
drama performance, where actors vividly bring a story to life. Additionally,
students will see the production process by observing how a live cooking
show is filmed. They’ll also have the chance to script and perform in front
of their peers at the green screen studio, further enhancing their skills
as Media Whiz Kids and allowing them to engage creatively with the medium.</p>
<p><strong>Sports Education Programme</strong>
<br>To help each Teck Whyean be a Healthy Individual, P2 pupils will attend
Archery exposure lessons as part of their&nbsp;<strong>Sports Education Programme.</strong>&nbsp;Through
this programme, pupils learn more about the sport, archery, as well as
the proper techniques of shooting a bow and arrow at a target.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Journeys</strong>
<br>P2 Children’s Museum Singapore (CMSG):&nbsp; Primary 2 pupils will embark
on an exciting learning journey to the Children’s Museum Singapore, where
they will explore the history and evolution of Singapore’s hawker culture.
They will learn about the cultural diversity of hawker fare, uncover stories
behind iconic hawker dishes, and understand the environmental sustainability
efforts within hawker culture. Through this experience, pupils&nbsp; will
develop a deeper appreciation for the hard work and values of hawkers while
gaining exposure to the people who make this vibrant culture possible.</p>
