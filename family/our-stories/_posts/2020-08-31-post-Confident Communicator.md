Hi, I am Aditya and I am currently studying in Victoria School. I certainly owe a lot to Teck Whye Primary School for shaping me to be the person I am today. From the supportive and nurturing environment to the diverse range of experiences, TWPS has helped me grow both holistically and academically. The teachers and staff were so supportive and, even when I felt like giving up on myself, they were always there to encourage me. I cannot help but be grateful for all that they have done for me.

TWPS has provided me with various opportunities and experiences that helped me to discover my strengths and work on my weaknesses. The CHAMPs and EXCEL values inculcated in me still guide me in my daily decisions and actions. For example, I was given several opportunities to hone my writing and speaking skills, developing me into a confident communicator. A memorable experience that comes to mind would be my time as a debater. Debating has indeed helped me in fine-tuning my writing and speaking skills.

As a debater, I was given the freedom to write my own points and this helped me to build up on my persuasive and argumentative writing skills. This experience piqued my interest in speaking and debating and I am very thankful for that. Another experience I am grateful for would be the several opportunities given to me to conduct presentations for the school. As a docent of the school, I had hosted many visitors to our school and this exposure is truly enriching for me. Moreover, the trust and encouragement from the teachers also helped to build my confidence and eloquence. To help me grow as a confident communicator, the teachers would give me insightful and constructive feedback on my performance so that I could constantly seek improvement.

When sitting through my English DSA interview to Victoria School, I understood how vital these opportunities were as I was composed and confident throughout the interview. Now that I am in secondary school, I am certainly very grateful to TWPS for all the enriching opportunities provided to me. The skills I have acquired are still relevant and useful to this day. To me, TWPS has been like a second home for me, moulding and guiding me every step of my future.
