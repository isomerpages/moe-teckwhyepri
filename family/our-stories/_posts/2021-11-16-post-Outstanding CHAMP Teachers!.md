The Teck Whye CHAMP teachers often show unwavering dedication and commitment towards teaching and also go beyond their call of duty to care for their students. For their outstanding contributions, they were presented with various accolades. Congratulations to all outstanding CHAMP Teachers!

**President’s Award for Teachers (PAT)**

The President’s Award for Teachers (PAT) recognises excellent educators for their role in moulding the future of our nation. One of the PAT recipients this year is Mr Nasrun Bin Mizzy, the Head of Department for Physical Education (PE) and Co-curricular Activities (CCA) at Teck Whye Primary School!

Mr Nasrun is an inspirational figure to both teachers and students as he constantly strives to create better learning experiences for everyone. During the pandemic, he leveraged on the power of collaboration and created a platform to share teaching resources with PE teachers around Singapore. His contribution to the teaching fraternity as well as his willingness to develop his students to their fullest potential certainly makes him deserving of the award.

**Caring Teacher Awards 2022**

The Caring Teacher Awards (CTA) by the National Institute of Education (NIE) aims to pay tribute to teachers who show care and concern for the holistic development of their students. They also go beyond their call of duty to ensure that their students will grow up to be confident, independent and resilient learners. Five teachers from Teck Whye Primary School received the ‘Caring Teacher Award’:

Mdm Azlina Bte Hassan  
Mdm Liew Yeow Wah, Joyce  
Mr Lim Kok Wee, Sebastian  
Mdm Tan Wan Foon  
Mdm Yeo Mui Poh (Mdm Lynn Yeo)

Thank you teachers for always taking care of Teck Whye CHAMPs!

**Outstanding Youth in Education Award (OYEA)**

Mdm Nurshirah Bte Adnan  
Miss Tan Xiu Ying Eileen  
Ms Jovita Wong Wan Jin

These teachers have demonstrated a strong belief in helping students to discover the joy of learning. They have also exemplified the spirit of lifelong learning as they seek to actively contribute to the teaching fraternity. Keep up the great work, teachers!
