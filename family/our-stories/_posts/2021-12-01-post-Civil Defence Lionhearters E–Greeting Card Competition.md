Five of our CHAMPs, who are our school’s Junior Civil Defence (CD) Lionhearters, participated in the CD Lionhearters’ E-Greeting Card Competition. They had to design cards that spread emergency preparedness and fire safety messages to the community. Out of more than 300 entries, two of our school’s Junior CD Lionhearters’ cards won the top 10 award! We would like to congratulate Soriano Faith Louise and Zay Yan Bhone from P5-5 for their achievements.

Well done to all our five Junior CD Lionhearters!
