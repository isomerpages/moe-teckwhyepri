<h1><strong>Principal's Message</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Growing Together in 2026 at Teck Whye Primary School</strong>
</p>
<p>We are delighted to welcome all families to a brand-new school year at
Teck Whye Primary School—especially our new Primary 1 parents joining us
for the first time. We look forward to partnering with you to support every
child’s learning, growth, and well-being.</p>
<p>As we begin 2026, we continue to anchor our work on our refreshed school
vision:
<br><strong>Empowered by Excellence, Guided by Values, Ready for Tomorrow.</strong>
<br>This year, we start by deepening our focus on what it means for our students
to be <strong>Empowered by Excellence</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>What Excellence Means at TWPS</strong>
</p>
<p>For us, excellence is not perfection. It is steady effort, purposeful
habits, and the courage to keep improving. We want our CHAMPs to know that
excellence is within their reach—built through resilience, responsibility,
and pride in doing their best.</p>
<p><strong>Empowering Students to Lead</strong>
</p>
<p>We believe students learn best when they are trusted with real opportunities
to lead. In 2025, our students stepped up with heart and excellence:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Student Counsellors</strong> led the planning of Teachers’ Day
and supported the Level Awards and P1 Orientation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Line Leaders and Safety Champs</strong> shaped daily routines and
modelled positive behaviours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Across events and classrooms, CHAMPs showed that when empowered, they
rise confidently to serve their school community.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2026, we will continue to strengthen these platforms so that every
child—through class roles, peer support, school events, or community programmes—can
experience what it means to lead, serve, and excel.</p>
<p><strong>Believing in Every CHAMP</strong>
</p>
<p>We believe every CHAMP can excel. With strong values and the right dispositions,
our students can shape their future and make a positive difference to those
around them. When they take initiative, act with care, and make thoughtful
choices, they grow not just as learners, but as young leaders. As we begin
this new year, we invite all parents to journey with us. Your encouragement,
together with our shared commitment in school, helps every child develop
the confidence, character, and competencies to thrive.</p>
<p>Thank you for being part of the Teck Whye family.</p>
<p><strong>Together, we grow—every child, every CHAMP.</strong>
</p>
<p>With gratitude for our partnership.
